## Contents
- `program1.ino` — Arduino sketch for controlling the motor performance assay rig.  
- `program2.ino` — Arduino sketch for sensor calibration and testing.  
- `workflow.bonsai` — Bonsai workflow file for data acquisition and processing.  

## Purpose
These files provide the supplemental programs used in the setup and operation of the motor performance assay rig described in the associated paper.

## Usage Notes
- Arduino sketches (`.ino` files) can be opened and uploaded using the Arduino IDE.  
- The Bonsai workflow (`.bonsai` file) can be opened in the Bonsai visual programming environment.  
- Refer to the paper’s Methods section for hardware setup details.
